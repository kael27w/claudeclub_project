# Project Pivot Summary - September 30, 2025

## 🔄 What Changed

### From: Crisis Management Application
**Original Focus:** Emergency travel assistance for students already abroad
**Status:** ✅ Fully functional MVP completed

### To: Study Abroad Destination Intelligence
**New Focus:** Pre-departure planning and real-time cost intelligence for study abroad students
**Status:** 🚧 Architecture defined, ready for implementation

---

## 📦 What Was Preserved

All crisis management functionality has been **safely backed up** in `/crisis-backup/` and will be integrated as a **secondary feature** once the primary destination intelligence system is built.

## 🔌 API Integration Strategy

### Priority 1 APIs for MVP
1. **Amadeus API** - Flight prices and trends
2. **Numbeo API** - Cost of living data
3. **Open Exchange Rates** - Currency monitoring
4. **Google Places API** - Local insights and activities

### Fallback Strategy
- Cache-first approach (5-minute TTL)
- Primary → Fallback → Mock data
- Claude AI for intelligent data interpretation

---

## 🔗 Integration Plan for Crisis Management

Once the destination intelligence MVP is complete, crisis management will be integrated as a **secondary feature**:

### Integration Approach
1. **Add route:** `/crisis` → Crisis management page
2. **Shared infrastructure:** Use same Claude agent base class
3. **Navigation:** Add "Emergency Help" button in main nav
4. **User flow:**
   ```
   Pre-departure → Destination Intelligence (Primary)
           ↓
   During Study Abroad → Crisis Management (Emergency)
   ```

### Benefits of This Approach
- Students get planning help BEFORE they leave
- Crisis management available when emergencies happen
- Comprehensive study abroad assistance platform
- Two complementary features, not competing ones

---

## 📈 Why This Pivot Makes Sense

### Problem with Original Approach
- Crisis management is **reactive** - only useful during emergencies
- Limited use case - most students don't have crises
- Hard to demo without simulating emergencies
- Doesn't address pre-departure planning needs

### Benefits of New Approach
- Destination intelligence is **proactive** - useful for ALL students
- Broader appeal - every study abroad student needs planning help
- Easy to demo with realistic scenarios
- Addresses real pain point: outdated university fact sheets
- Crisis management becomes valuable **add-on** feature

### Market Validation
- University fact sheets are notoriously outdated (6-12 months old)
- Flight/housing prices change daily
- Currency fluctuations impact budgets significantly
- Students need real-time, personalized guidance
- No existing tools combine all these features

---

## 🎯 Success Metrics

### Technical Goals
- Query to useful intelligence: < 5 seconds
- API response time: < 500ms (p95)
- Cache hit rate: > 80%
- Information accuracy: > 95%
