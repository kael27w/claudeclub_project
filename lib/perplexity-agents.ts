-   Housing (shared apartment in ${neighborhoodContext}) - provide cost in ${localCurrency}.
-   Food (mix of groceries and cheap eats) - provide cost in ${localCurrency}.
-   Local Transportation (monthly pass) - provide cost in ${localCurrency}.
-   Utilities (internet, mobile plan) - provide cost in ${localCurrency}.

### Housing Options (COSTS IN ${localCurrency})
-   Typical cost for university dormitories vs. private shared apartments in ${localCurrency}.
-   Good, safe neighborhoods for students to live in, such as ${neighborhoodContext}, near ${universityContext}.

### Cultural Insights
-   Key social etiquette and customs that might differ from ${originLocation}.
-   Brief overview of the student social scene and nightlife.

### Safety Analysis
-   List 3-4 verifiably safe neighborhoods for students (include ${neighborhoodContext} if applicable).
-   List 1-2 areas to be more cautious in, especially at night.
-   Mention any common scams targeting tourists or students.

### Personalized Recommendations
-   Based on the student's interests in ${interests}, suggest 2-3 specific activities, locations, or experiences.`;
