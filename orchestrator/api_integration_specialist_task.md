## Specific Requirements

### APIs to Analyze

#### 1. Google Maps APIs (PRIMARY)
**Purpose:** Location services, route planning, place search
**Required Analysis:**
- Google Maps JavaScript API (for interactive maps)
- Google Places API (for location search, details, photos)
- Google Directions API (for route optimization)
- Google Geocoding API (for address conversion)
- Authentication: API key management
- Rate limits and quota considerations
- Pricing tiers and cost optimization strategies
- **CRITICAL:** Mock data strategy for demo scenarios (Tokyo crisis, European route planning)

#### 2. Flight & Travel APIs
**Options to Evaluate:**
- **Amadeus API** (leading choice - comprehensive flight data)
- **Skyscanner API** (flight search and price comparison)
- **Aviationstack API** (real-time flight status)
- **OpenSky Network** (free flight tracking)

**Analysis Required:**
- Comparison matrix: features, pricing, reliability, data quality
- Recommendation for primary API + fallback options
- Authentication and rate limiting
- Data freshness and update frequency
- **CRITICAL:** Mock flight data for all 3 demo scenarios

#### 3. Weather APIs
**Purpose:** Crisis detection and travel planning
**Options:**
- OpenWeatherMap API (weather forecasts)
- WeatherAPI.com (alerts and forecasts)
- Weatherstack (simple weather data)

**Analysis Required:**
- Real-time alert capabilities
- Historical data access
- Forecast accuracy and range
- **CRITICAL:** Mock severe weather data for Demo 1 (Tokyo typhoon)

#### 4. Accommodation APIs
**Options:**
- Booking.com API (if accessible)
- Airbnb API considerations
- Alternative: Web scraping + mock data strategy

**Analysis Required:**
- Feasibility assessment for each option
- Mock data design for budget hostels, emergency accommodations
- Filtering capabilities (kitchens for vegetarians, student-friendly)

### Mock Data Strategy (MISSION CRITICAL)

Must create comprehensive mock schemas for:

#### Demo 1: Tokyo Crisis Scenario
- Severe weather alert (typhoon)
- Train service shutdown notifications
- Flight rebooking options
- Emergency accommodation availability
- Airport transfer alternatives (taxi, private car, hotel shuttle)
- Insurance claim data

#### Demo 2: European Multi-Country Planning
- Visa requirement data (5 countries)
- Eurail route optimization
- Tech museums and events data
- Hostel listings with kitchen facilities
- Vegetarian restaurant data by country
- Student discount opportunities

#### Demo 3: Group Coordination
- Multiple user preference profiles
- Conflicting availability data
- Budget range variations
- Activity voting scenarios
- Cost-splitting calculations

### Fallback Architecture Requirements

Design 3-tier fallback strategy:
1. **Tier 1:** Live API (primary)
2. **Tier 2:** Cached data (recent, validated)
3. **Tier 3:** Mock data (curated, scenario-specific)

**Switching Logic:**
- API health monitoring criteria
- Latency thresholds
- Error rate thresholds
- Demo mode toggle (forces Tier 3)

### Integration Patterns

Recommend:
- **API Service Layer:** Abstract API-specific implementation
- **Adapter Pattern:** Standardize responses across different APIs
- **Circuit Breaker:** Prevent cascade failures
- **Request Queue:** Batch and throttle API calls
- **Cache Strategy:** Redis/memory caching with TTL

### Security & Best Practices

Must cover:
- Environment variable management for API keys
- Rate limit handling and retry logic
- Error response standardization
- API request/response logging (sanitized)
- CORS and API proxy considerations (Next.js API routes)

## Output Structure

## Timeline

**Estimated Effort:** 3-4 hours
**Deadline:** Must complete before implementation planning phase begins

## Next Steps After Completion

Upon completion, your output will be used by:
1. **frontend-developer** - To design API consumption patterns in React components
2. **backend-developer** - To implement API routes and service layers
3. **qa-testing-agent** - To create test scenarios using mock data
4. **shadcn-ui-designer** - To design loading states and error UI

## Questions or Clarifications

If you need clarification on:
- Specific API capabilities or alternatives
- Mock data scenarios or edge cases
- Integration patterns or architectural decisions

Document assumptions clearly in your output and proceed with best judgment based on the 48-hour competition constraint.
