# Crisis Management Application - Backup

## Overview
This folder contains the complete, working crisis management application that was built during the initial MVP phase. It has been preserved here to be integrated later as a secondary feature of the study abroad assistant.

## What This Application Does
The crisis management system helps students and travelers resolve travel emergencies in real-time using AI-powered analysis and solution generation.

### Features
- **Crisis Input**: Natural language description of travel emergencies
- **AI Analysis**: Claude AI analyzes crisis severity, identifies issues, and assesses time constraints
- **3-Tier Solutions**: Generates Fast/Balanced/Budget solutions for every crisis
- **Real-time Execution**: Step-by-step progress tracking with animations
- **Demo Mode**: Comprehensive mock data for reliable presentations

### Supported Crisis Types
1. Flight Cancellations
2. Natural Disasters (Typhoons, earthquakes, etc.)
3. Lost Documents (Passport, visa, ID)

## Application Structure

### Frontend Components (`components/`)
- **CrisisInput.tsx**: Crisis description form with example scenarios
- **SolutionCard.tsx**: Expandable solution cards with cost/time/feasibility
- **StatusDisplay.tsx**: Real-time execution progress display

### API Routes (`app/api/crisis/`)
- **analyze/route.ts**: POST endpoint for crisis analysis
- **solve/route.ts**: POST endpoint for solution generation
- **status/route.ts**: POST endpoint for solution execution

### Core Logic (`lib/`)
- **claude-agent.ts**: CrisisManagementAgent class with AI reasoning
- **mock-data.ts**: Demo mode mock responses (9 solutions across 3 scenarios)
- **types/crisis.ts**: TypeScript interfaces for crisis data

### Main Page
- **app/page.tsx**: 5-stage state machine managing the entire user flow

## Technical Details

### State Machine Flow
1. `input` - User describes crisis
2. `analyzing` - AI analyzes situation
3. `solutions` - Display 3 solution options
4. `executing` - Execute selected solution step-by-step
5. `complete` - Show results and reset option

### Demo Mode
- Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEMO_MODE=true` in `.env.local`
- Uses mock data from `lib/mock-data.ts`
- Simulates realistic API delays (1.5s - 2s)
- Zero API costs, fully reliable

### API Integration
- Uses Claude 4.5 API for real-time reasoning
- Automatic fallback to mock data if API fails
- Structured JSON response parsing

## Testing Status
✅ All core functionality tested and working
✅ All 3 crisis scenarios verified (Flight, Typhoon, Lost Passport)
✅ Build successful with 0 errors, 0 warnings
✅ TypeScript strict mode compliant
✅ 93 kB First Load JS (excellent performance)

## Integration Plan
This crisis management feature will be integrated as a secondary feature alongside the primary study abroad destination intelligence system. Students can use it when they encounter emergencies while abroad.

## Documentation

## Backup Date
September 30, 2025

## Status
✅ Fully functional MVP
✅ Ready for integration
✅ Preserved for future use
